# counterattack

Now you can generate your own Counter Attack player cards for real-life players!

This package creates a 'Counter Attack: The Football Strategy Game' player card data file for any real-life player from 'Football Manager' data. 
The player card data file that is created is intended to be used with the Counter Attack Custom Card Generator created by Konrad Frac (https://github.com/kkoripl).
